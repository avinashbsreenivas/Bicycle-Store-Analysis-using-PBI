# Bicycle (AdventureWorks) Store Analysis

This is the first project I created for my Data Analysis portfolio, as a part of Maven Analytics Power BI Course and developed a bit further using some tips from other resources â€” shout out to Guy In A Cube for some very cool tips and videos.

### The Data
This data comes from Maven Analytics and is hypothetical, as mentioned above. The data was stored in 3 separate tables, with 56,046 rows of sales data, 1,809 rows of returns data and 293 rows of product data. The raw data is provided as part of this course and so is only accessible as part of this course.

## Problem Statement

The Adventure Works company represents a bicycle manufacturer that sells bicycles and related accessories to global markets. The dataset contains 
* Product data (Product Key, Product Price, SKU Type, etc.,)
* Customer data (Customer Key, First Name, Last Name, Income Level, etc.,)
* Sales data (Order Date, Territory Key, Order Quantity, etc.,)

The following dashboards helps paint a picture as to how the store operates under various circumstances.

* Executive Dashboard - A Holistic View of the overall business
* Geographic Analysis - Region-wise business condition
* Product Details - Real-time  product and accessories report
* Customer Details - Real-time customer report


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Customer Table" 
- Step 5 : Null values were replaced by Zeros and errors related to customer's birthdate were not taken into account to eliminate result skewness 
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected
- Step 7 : In the report view, under the insert tab, using shapes option from elements group a rectangle was inserted & similarly using image option company's logo was added to the report design area
- Step 8 : Calculated column was created in which, customer's were segmented into income levels, education categories, and Priority segments (based on annual income)

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
        
       Customer Priority = 
                    IF(
                        'Customer Lookup'[AnnualIncome] > 100000 &&
                        'Customer Lookup'[Is Parent?] = "Yes", "Priority",
                        "Standard")

![customer_priority_1](https://github.com/ZubayerOjhor/E-Commerce-Dashboard/assets/82948527/5150ee52-9016-4251-9b45-f1e0d126f803)

        
- Step 9 : New measure was created to find total revenue, revenue target to name a few (total 40 Measures were calculated for this project)

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Total Revenue = 
                    SUMX(
                        'Sales Data',
                        'Sales Data'[OrderQuantity]
                        *
                        RELATED(
                        'Product Lookup'[ProductPrice]
                        ))       
A card visual was used to represent Total Revenue (in $)

 - Step 10 : New measure was created to find  Previous Month Revenue (in $)
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
        Previous Month Revenue = 
                            CALCULATE(
                                [Total Revenue],
                                DATEADD(
                                    'Calendar Lookup'[Date],
                                    -1,
                                    MONTH
                                ))
 
 A card visual was used to represent Previous Month Revenue (in $)

 - Step 11 : New measure "Total Return" was created to calculate total number of items retuned & a card visual was used to represent the same
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Return Rate = 
                    DIVIDE(
                        [Quantity Returned],
                        [Quantity Sold],
                        "No Sales")
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.

 - Step 18 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.
